You'll study proposed legislation and meet with constituents and representatives of various interest groups. You may draft bills to be presented for a vote by legislative committees, each house chamber and by the full legislature. In many states, legislators serve part-time or for the portion of the year when the legislature is in session. During other periods you may travel your district to attend events and meet with constituents to gain insight on local issues. You'll also be working on political activities such as your re-election campaign.\",\n",

You'll need to obtain the endorsement of your party, often through primary elections, and then run for office in the general election. An option may be to run as an independent candidate.
